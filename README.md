This repository will contain examples and tutorials ranging from:

## Beginners

For beginners it is suggested to completely install the [Deamer project](https://github.com/Deruago/theDeamerProject) (at least [Deamer](https://github.com/Deruago/theDeamerProject), [DLDL](https://github.com/Deruago/DLDL), and [Deamer External](https://github.com/Deruago/DeamerExternal)), and start by using DLDL.

DLDL is a tool to implement definitions for Deamer CC. Aside from being a front-end for Deamer CC, it is also the main tool for starting and maintaining language projects.
